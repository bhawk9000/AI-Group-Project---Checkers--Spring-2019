git status
	- Displays tracked and untracked files with changes 
	(what will and what will not be put in a commit if you make one right now).

git add .
	- Adds files to be tracked for next commit.
		- the '.' means everything, but you can specify a filepath if you would like
		- e.g. git add Source/Source.cpp
			Will only add Source.cpp in the Source directory, relative to your working directory

git commit -m [Message]
	- Rolls all current staged changes into a package of sorts and adds a message describing what this 
	commit will do to the codebase (what it changes)
	
git commit -am [Message]
	- Same as "git commit -m [Message]", but will automatically track any untracked changes in files 
	THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDED BEFORE (only tracks modifications to files, not entirely new files).
	
git push origin master
	- Pushes any commits that are on this local machine to the remote repository. This actually moves the 
	changes from your machine to the remote repository.
	
git pull origin master
	- Pulls all changes from the remote server down to your local machine. This updates your code.
	

NOTE: ALWAYS PULL BEFORE YOU START AND ALWAYS PUSH WHEN YOU FINISH
	- If there is a change in the remote version of a file AND if there is a change to the local 
	version of a file (something changed since the last push/pull), there will likely be a 
	MERGE CONFLICT.
		- These are painful and usually have to be handled manually.
		- Lets coordinate so we dont work on the same file at once to avoid this.
